  "description": "What is my project? My project includes addition, subtraction, multiplication division and remainder, big positive integer operation(Operations greater than 16 digits). Why create it? When I write algorithm in javascript, I encounter the problem of explosion accuracy (when the number of digits is greater than 16, the calculation result is inaccurate). How to use it? These mathematical operation methods can be used by referring to this javascript file as < script src=\"\"></script > expression in the project and creating Cal objects(Numbers are string types).",
